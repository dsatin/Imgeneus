# Imgeneus

Imgeneus is a simple and elegant Shaiya EP8 socket server over the TCP/IP protocol, built with C# 10 and .NET 6.0.

This project has been created for learning purposes about the network and game logic problematics on the server-side.
We choose [Shaiya](https://shaiya.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) because  it is a simple game, but enough complex to learn the basic functions of an MMO game architecture.
It's not about playing a game or competing with any services provided by Aeriagames or its partners, and we don't endorse such actions.

This repo also uses the best parts of these repos: [Drakkus/ShaiyaGenesis](https://github.com/Drakkus/ShaiyaGenesis), [Origin](https://github.com/aosyatnik/Origin) and original Imgeneus (removed by creator).

## EP 4.5 development fork

The `develop/ep45-compatibility` branch preserves the experimental Linux/EP4.5
work and defines a client-first compatibility plan in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
The [client reference](docs/client-ep45/README.md) tracks extraction, evidence
and coverage. Complete client documentation precedes backend implementation;
the current experiment does not provide full EP4.5 support.

## Solution description

##### Imgeneus.Core
Core contains some common helpers, extensions etc.

##### Imgeneus.Database
We are using EF Core for database connections and migrations. You can read more about EF [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

##### Imgeneus.Network
Includes packet definition from client to server and cryptography implementation.

##### Imgeneus.Logs
In-game logs, that are saved via SQLite in file.

##### Imgeneus.InterServer
Communication between servers (login and game) is done with the help of SignalR. You can read more about SignalR [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr).

##### Imgeneus.Game
Game logic.

##### Imgeneus.Login
Login server, that handles all packets in the login screen. Redirects to the selected game server.

##### Imgeneus.World
Game server. As well as login server, it's TCP server running on top of ASP.Net Core. You can read more about ASP.Net [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core).

##### Unit tests
Any game feature must have a corresponding unit test.

### Database migrations
* Migrations are done automatically as soon as you run world server.
* You can also migrate manually via Package console or .NET cli. You can read more about migrations [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/).
* To fulfill the database with example data open `src\Imgeneus.Database\Migrations\sql` folder and run `setup.bat` file (Don't forget to set your password there). This will populate your database with ep6 original data.

#### Client versions support
Our main goal is learning, clients are used only for testing. We are not trying to harm any server or dev team. That's why we are not exposing any clients or server name, where these clients are used. Next versions supported:
